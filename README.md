# NVChad Custom Folder
Welcome to the NVChad custom folder! This folder is designed to house all your custom plugins and modifications for your NVChad setup. It provides a convenient way to add new functionality an customize your NVChad configuration without modifying the core files directly.


## Getting Started
To begin, make sure you have NVChad already set up and running on your system. If you haven't installed NVChad yet, please refer to the official NVChad documentation for instructions on how to set it up.

Once you have NVChad up and running, follow these steps to utilize the custom folder:

- Locate the NVChad custom folder in your NVChad installation directory.
- Copy your custom plugins and modifications into the custom folder.
- Ensure that you adhere to the folder structure and naming conventions outlined by NVChad.

## Folder structure
The custom folder should mirror the structure of the NVChad installation directory. This structure helps maintain organization and ensures that NVChad can find and load your custom additions correctly.
